<h1> Machine learning: </h1>

<p> Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves. </p>

<h1> Advantages : </h1>
<ul><li> Easily identifies trends and patterns. </li>
<li> No human intervention needed (automation). </li>
<li> Handling multi-dimensional and multi-variety data. </li>
<li> Wide Applications. </li>
<li> They are used every day to make critical decisions in medical diagnosis, stock trading, energy load forecasting, and more. </li>
</ul>

<h1> Why Machine Learning Matters: </h1>
<p> With the rise in big data, machine learning has become a key technique for solving problems in areas, such as: </p>
<ul><li> Computational finance, for credit scoring and algorithmic trading </li>
<li> Image processing and computer vision, for face recognition, motion detection, and object detection </li>
<li> Computational biology, for tumor detection, drug discovery, and DNA sequencing </li>
<li> Energy production, for price and load forecasting </li>
<li> Automotive, aerospace, and manufacturing, for predictive maintenance </li>
<li> Natural language processing, for voice recognition applications  </li>
</ul>
